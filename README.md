What is this project?
This is a C++ console program that helps store and manage employee data. It can:
 Add new employees (permanent or temporary)
 Calculate their salaries automatically
 Display all employees or search by ID

Why is it useful?
For Students: Helps learn OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
For Small Businesses: Can replace manual record-keeping for 10-50 employees.
For Future Upgrades: Can be expanded with databases, GUI, or AI tools later.

How does it work?
Menu-Driven Interface: Simple numbered options (1-4)

Two Employee Types:

Permanent (fixed monthly salary)
Visiting (paid per day worked)

No Complex Setup: Runs on any laptop with a C++ compiler.
